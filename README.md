# JavaScript SBA

## A bit about the SBA

I attempted to itierate through the data and compare ids and find averages and test scores. I am struggling with this Assesment a lot. I find I understand the basics of JavaScript, but not necessarily how to put what I know into practice.

I managed to make the try/catch work to find that the Course ID matched, but that's most of what I accomplished.

My SBA includes a lot of failed functions, which I had a really hard time with. I am struggling with how to condense all of this data into a readable array.

JavaScript is HARD!
